```typescript
import { Resend } from 'resend'
const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY)

export async function sendOrderConfirmationEmail(order: OrderData) {
  const response = await resend.emails.send({
    from: 'orders@freshtropicsasianfruits.com',
    to: order.customerEmail,
    subject: `Order Confirmed: ${order.orderNumber}`,
    html: generateOrderConfirmationEmail(order),
  })
  return response

  const newOrderNumber = generateOrderNumber()
  
  const order: OrderData = {
    orderNumber: newOrderNumber,
    customerName,
    customerEmail,
    items: items.map(item => ({
      id: item.id,
      name: item.name,
