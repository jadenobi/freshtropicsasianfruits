                My family has always been connected to the land. Growing up in a Cuban-American household, our kitchen was always filled with fresh avocados, mangos, yuca, and other fruits with names that to this day, I still have trouble pronouncing.

                Because of our family's business, I was raised visiting farms in the Caribbean, Central, and South America. One of my first memories, was as a young girl in the mountains of Ecuador. I was holding my Dad's hand as I saw a pack of mules with large sacks draped over their sides, guided down a mountain by a farmer. They were carrying a load of a local root, known as malanga. Covered in fresh dirt, the root was brown with thread-like hairs on the outside. 
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed italic bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-emerald-600">
                "It doesn't get any fresher than this!" the proud farmer said as he broke the root in half with a crisp snap. Ugly-looking on the outside, the inside was pristine and white as snow.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                My Dad smiled, examined the freshness and passed it to me. At the time, I had no idea what this strange root was, but seeing my father light up and how proud the farmer was, I knew it had to be something special. That moment changed my perspective on food forever.
